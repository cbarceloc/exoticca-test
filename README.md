## Architecture

In this project, we have implemented a unique frontend architecture called Feature-Clean Architecture, designed by myself (https://github.com/cbarceloc). This architecture combines the strengths of two powerful paradigms: Clean Architecture and Feature-Sliced Design. By integrating these methodologies, we aim to enhance modularity, scalability, and maintainability in our codebase. This approach allows for a more organized and efficient development process, ensuring that each feature is well-isolated and that dependencies are properly managed. If you want to know more about this architecture, check my post:
